I cannot think of anyone who has not encountered a backpain once in a while.

Urban Lifestyle,Corporate job, Constantly sitting in the same position lead me into this uncomfortable and undesirable condition.

However, it can be hard to differentiate on your own if the intensity is Normal or Abnormal.

Lower back pain is caused by injury to a muscle (strain) or ligament (sprain). Common causes include improper lifting, poor posture, lack of regular exercise, a fracture, a ruptured disc or arthritis.

While lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly.

Often, the only symptom is pain in the lower back.

Most low back pain goes away on its own in two to four weeks.

A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.Physiotherapy and pain relievers can help. A few cases may require surgery.

This Project is about to identify if a person's back pain is abnormal or normal using collected physical spine details/data.

Here is a correlation plot to get a peak into the attributes of the dataset:
